These are the current files for SuperNova.
SuperNova_Core is a form of SuperNova that renames all console references to Nova, and adds a custom instance of the previous console state.
NOTE: FOR SuperNova_Core YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD SuperNovaCLI_Core AND SuperNova_CoreGUI AS WELL SINCE ALL CONSOLE STATES WILL BE RENAMED!
SuperNova_infid is only here to allow older versions to update, as SuperNova_ comes with 767 blocks now.
